DESCRIPTION
The Number Guessing Game in C++ is a simple console-based application where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess it. 
After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess is too high or too low, and continues until the correct number is guessed. 
The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.
